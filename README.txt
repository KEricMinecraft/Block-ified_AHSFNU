Welcome to Project Block-ified Affiliated High School of FNU! 
We are trying to rebuild the campus in a Minecraft save with hands(I mean keyboards and mice lmao). 
Anyone could be a candidate of the project with their passion and knowledge about the campus. 

If you would like to join us, the things you have to know about are here: 
  1. As said, you should master what the campus is like - every single inch. 
  2. You need hours of free time to do buildings. 
  3. You should NEVER RUIN OTHERS' WORKS, BUILD ANYTHING THAT CAN BLOCK THE SPACE SET ASIDE FOR BUILDINGS, BUILD CATCHY SIGNATURES/IMAGES OR UPLOADE TROLL FILES(i.e. damaged files). 
  4. After entering the world, FIND THE COMMAND BLOCK to TELEPORT TO RIGHT POSITION, or your efforts will lay in ruins. 
  5. Except those rotated buildings, any buildings are supposed to be powered by an energy system and equipped by useable machines(i.e. elevators and vending machines) like Yinghua Building. 
  6. The structure of the underground part is free - you can even build an underground maze like what I have done. 
  7. If possible, your building should be properly scaled to what the building is like in real life. 

Have a good time in Minecraft!
